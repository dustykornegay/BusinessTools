Dear Sir/Madam,
Please help me plan, act and do until your organization runs like it is on rails.

I may not be any good at business process and value stream mapping.
I may not understand the value of a clean workspace.
I may not understand the variability of your materials and products.

I strongly desire to learn and I always want to know the answers to to the questions:

What are you doing? and Why?

Followed by:

What do you want to do?
Why don't you do it? (What's stopping you?)


That is in my opinion, Human & Corporate motivation in a nutshell.

I believe that these four questions are at the heart of Transformational Leadership.

For a corporation like Raytheon, I believe tools like business process and value stream mapping provide useful information that senior leadership needs to make critical management decisions.

People are most productive when they do what they love. So it is important to ask the 'What do you want to do?' question. Helping individuals achieve they're real dreams is a huge corporate advantage.

I absolutely believe that this is quite possibly a dominant growth strategy in today's market place.
I am only sharing with you, because quite frankly, my personal balance sheet isn't balancing.

I want to take these beliefs, and put them into action. Surely Raytheon management has looked at Google, and Toyota for inspiration. Raytheon is not ranked as one of the top 100 places to work:

There is no reason can't be and I would like to do my part to ensure Raytheon makes the list next year.

Thank You for considering my background and expertise.

Sincerely,

George 'Dusty' Kornegay
